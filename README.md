## Overview of Project
### Louise is a playwright looking to successfully fund her play, Fever. Louise's play came close to raising it's funding goal is a short period, and she wants to know how this campaign compares to other theater campaigns in relation to their fundraising goals and launch dates.  We will be able to determine the best month for her play to launch and the likelihood of her campaign's success based on fundraising goal. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The data was conducted by extracting...

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the analysis for play outcomes when compared to launch date, we found the May to be the best month to start a campaign due to the high success rate of plays launched in that month.
We also conclude that December had about an equal chance of success or failure based on the near equal number of plays that were successful and that failed in that month. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the analysis for play outcomes based on goal, we found that as the goal for plays increased, the chance of success decreased.  This was found as a trend for both successful and failed plays.  Plays that had the highest chance of success had the lowest goals, while plays that had the highest goals had the highest chance of failure.
