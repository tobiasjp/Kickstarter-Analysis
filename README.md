# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
### Louise is a playwright looking to successfully fund her play, Fever, through campaign fundraising. Louise's play came close to raising it's funding goal is a short period, and she wants to know how this campaign compares to other theater campaigns in relation to their fundraising goals and launch dates.  We will be able to determine the best month for her campaign to launch and the likelihood of her campaign's success based on fundraising goal. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In order to increase her chance of success, Louise wanted to determine the best month to launch her campaign.  We started by isolating the data to show only campaigns under the category of play, filtering only campaigns that had the outcome of "successful", "failed" and "cancelled", and organizing by month the campaign launched.  This data is expected to inform the reader based on month the play is launched, what are the chances of success.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Louise would also like to consider how likely her campaign is to succeed based on past fundraising goals.  To perform this analysis, we isolated the data to show only campaigns under the category of play, filtering only campaigns that had the outcome of "successful", "failed" and "cancelled", and organized based on 10 ranges of $5,000 increments for campaign goals between $0-$50,000, and grouping all goals above $50,000 as one range.  This data is expected to inform the reader about the likelihood of success based on campaign goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results

Based on the analysis for play outcomes when compared to launch date, we found:
- May to be the best month to start a campaign due to the high success rate of plays launched in that month.
- December had about an equal chance of success or failure based on the near equal number of plays that were successful and that failed in that month. 

Based on the analysis for play outcomes based on goal, we found: 
- As the funding goal for plays increased, the chance of success decreased.  This was found as a trend for both successful and failed plays.  
  -Plays that had the highest chance of success had the lowest goals.
  -Plays that had the highest goals had the highest chance of failure.
